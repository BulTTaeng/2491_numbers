## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just count the number if the current number is smaller than previous one or current number is bigger than previouse one.

If not, reset the dp[i] to 1.

After that , find the max value.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
